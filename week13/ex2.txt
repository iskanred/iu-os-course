1) Recovery requires one of the four methods to deal with deadlock (preemtion, rollback, kill all deadlocked processes, abort one process at a time until the elimination of the deadblock cycle). Recovery strategy then can either be too long in execution or make system to go into starvation.

2) Avoidance is the best strategy which uses Banker's algorithm. However, it requires the information about how many resources a process would need in advance. Because of halting problem in the real world it is impossible.

3) Prevention is used in real systems. It works by eliminating the conditions of deadblocks existence (Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No preemption, Circular wait).
